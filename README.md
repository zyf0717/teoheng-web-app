# custom-th-mobile-interface

custom-th-mobile-interface is an alternative web UI for karaoke devices that expose the stock KOD HTTP/JSONP endpoints.

This app focuses on a cleaner browser interface for:

- searching songs
- queueing and prioritizing songs
- viewing the current playlist
- sending playback, pitch, and volume commands

The UI talks directly to the karaoke device over the local network. It does not include a backend proxy.

## Stack

- Vue 3
- Vite
- Vitest

```

## Development

Install dependencies first, then use the normal Vite commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Other useful commands:

```bash
npm run test
npm run build
npm run preview
npm run mock:kod
```

Recommended Node version: 22.x (matches CI workflows).

## Manual UI Testing

For manual browser testing without a real karaoke device, run the local mock KOD server:

```bash
npm run mock:kod
```

Then start the app separately:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the app with this base URL:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

The mock server lives in [`tools/mock-kod-server.mjs`](tools/mock-kod-server.mjs). It implements the JSONP endpoints used by the app, keeps an in-memory playlist, handles command actions, and serves placeholder singer artwork so you can test the actual UI and UX flow in a browser.

## Device Setup

The app expects a device base URL such as:

```text
http://device-ip:8080
```

For best compatibility, serve and open the app over plain `http://` on the same local network as the karaoke device.

In the UI, you can usually get this from the QR code shown by the karaoke system.
If the QR scanner is unavailable on your browser or OS, enter the server URL manually instead.

### Browser Compatibility Notes

Browsers do not all handle local-network access the same way when the app is hosted on a public domain and the KOD box or mock server is on a private LAN address such as `http://192.168.x.x:8080`.

- Safari can work with an `http://` app origin in some setups. This also generally applies to all iOS browsers, because iOS browsers share the same WebKit backend. The following pattern has been confirmed to work during manual testing:

```text
http://ktv.yifei.sg/?baseUrl=http%3A%2F%2F172.24.132.70%3A8080
```

- Chrome is stricter about private-network access from a public site. This behavior also matches Android Chrome in practice. During manual testing, Chrome required all of the following:
  - opening the app over `https://`
  - using the LAN IP of the KOD box or mock server
  - allowing access to local devices or the local network when prompted by the browser

This pattern was confirmed to work in Chrome:

```text
https://ktv.yifei.sg/?baseUrl=http%3A%2F%2F172.24.132.70%3A8080
```

## Permissions

- Camera access is only needed if you use the QR scanner.
- Camera scanning may not work on some browser and operating system combinations.
- Browser handling of local-network access varies, and may require an `https://` app origin and explicit permission to access local devices or the local network.
- The app is intended for direct local-network access, without a backend proxy.
- Browser behavior can still vary across platforms, and may or may not require an explicit browser-level local-network permission trigger.

## How It Works

custom-th-mobile-interface uses the same browser-facing endpoints as the stock device UI:

- `SearchServlet` for song search
- `PlaylistServlet` for queue and playback state
- `CommandServlet` for control commands
- `/singer/<file>.jpg` for singer pictures

These endpoints return JSONP rather than plain JSON, so the frontend uses dynamic script injection.

That means the device response is usually shaped like:

```js
jQuery1111_123456789({...})
```

or:

```js
__openKodJsonp_123456789({...})
```

The object inside the parentheses is JSON data, but the full response is JSONP.

## Endpoint Reference

The currently known API behavior, discovered from the stock UI and live endpoint testing, is documented in:

[docs/endpoints.md](docs/endpoints.md)

## Notes

- This app is designed for local-network use.
- For best compatibility, run the app from a plain `http://` origin on the same local network as the KTV box.
